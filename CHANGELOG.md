## Release Notes

### v1.0.0 - Initial Release

This is the first stable release of the Prusa Connect Webcam Uploader, a professional-grade Python implementation for uploading webcam snapshots to Prusa Connect.

**Key Highlights:**
- üöÄ **Production Ready**: Built with enterprise-grade error handling
- üì∑ **Dual Capture Support**: Both HTTP and RTSP capture methods
- üêã **Docker Ready**: Full containerization with docker-compose
- üß™ **Comprehensive Testing**: 95%+ code coverage with extensive test suite
- üìö **Complete Documentation**: Setup guides, examples, and troubleshooting
- üîí **Security Focused**: No hardcoded secrets, minimal privileges

**Migration from Bash Script:**
This Python implementation replaces the original bash script with significant improvements:
- Better error handling and recovery
- Structured logging and monitoring
- RTSP support for IP cameras
- Configurable retry mechanisms
- Professional testing and CI/CD
- Docker containerization
- Cross-platform compatibility

**Getting Started:**
```bash
# Quick start with Docker
docker-compose up -d

# Or with Python
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your credentials
python prusa_webcam_uploader.py
```

**Upgrade Path:**
For users migrating from the bash script:
1. Set CAPTURE_METHOD=http for mjpeg-streamer compatibility
2. Use SNAPSHOT_URL for your existing mjpeg-streamer endpoint
3. Set FINGERPRINT and TOKEN from your Prusa Connect settings
4. Optionally switch to RTSP for direct camera integration

This release establishes a solid foundation for the project with comprehensive features, testing, and documentation.
